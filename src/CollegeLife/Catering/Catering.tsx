        College provides a number of regular catering services so that
        Girtonians have one less thing to worry about when in College! Students
        are able to use them without any contractual obligation beforehand,
        creating a uniquely catered and self-catered university experience at
        the same time, compared to other colleges and universities. Don&apos;t

      <h3>Overview of Girton&apos;s Catering Facilities</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main facilities open daily at Girton for use by both
        students and visitors to the college.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Cafeteria (Or “Hall”)- Serving lunch and Dinner.</li>
        <li>
          The Social Hub (Or “Schlub”)- Serving a variety of snacks and drinks
          all day such as pizza, paninis, sandwiches and hot and cold beverages.
          You can find the Social Hub on{' '}

          .
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Michaelmas Term opening times for Hall and Schlub will be available
        soon. However, times may differ each week.{' '}
      </p>
      <p>
        Be aware, at certain times/datesSchlub may close and Hall may not be
        available to “eat in” (takeaway boxes only). These closures will be made
        aware to students, staff and fellows via email, so check regularly for
        any sudden changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another regular catering event that Cambridge is famous for is Formal
        Halls.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Formal Halls (known as “Formals”)- 3-course meals served in the Great
          Hall. Usually on a Thursday weekly during term time with tickets
          needing to be booked in advance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hall</h3>
      <p>
        Hall is the main place to get lunch/dinner in College, with specific
        opening times (as opposed to Schlub which is open much more often).
        Daily and weekly menus for Hall can be found on the{' '}

        </a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Substantial meals are available here with a usual price of £4 for a meal
        containing meat, or £3.50 for vegetarian/vegan options and both come
        with sides and vegetables! (Note- due to the cost of fish, some fish
        dishes may be priced at £4.50 but prices will be made known to you
        outside the hall and in the queue). These are prices for Girton members,
        external prices are double what a Girtonian would pay. (These prices
        were accurate for the 2021/22 academic year)
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also the option for deserts like cakes and cookies, as well as
        snacks like chocolate and of course many drinks like juices, fizzy
        drinks and water for free (available inside the hall where there is a
        water fountain and clean glasses to use).
      </p>
      <p>
        As food for students is subsidised by College and so undergrads pay
        Member Prices in Hall and Schlub when paying with their university
        cards. These have a credit limit of £500, which can be topped up on
        <a href="https://www.upay.co.uk/app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
          Upay
        </a>
        , and the remaining balance is added to your College Bill at the end of
        each term.
      </p>
      <p>
        Food can be taken away in boxes or you can eat in the Great Hall! (if
        eating in the Hall please ensure clothing is appropriate, pyjamas,
        slippers, swimming costumes etc, are not appropriate for a public dining
        place, as noted on the Catering moodle page).
      </p>
      <h3>Social Hub</h3>
      <p>
        The Girton College Social Hub Café/Bar, or &quot;Schlub&quot; as
        it&apos;s known to nearly all students is essentially a café in College,
        where students often sit and study or enjoy a snack or two with friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schlub provides a variety of snacks, drinks, sandwiches, hot and cold
        teas and coffees, and most importantly, cake! Like hall, all food and
        soft drinks are paid for via university card. All products here are also
        subsidised for Girtonians and more expensive for external guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Schlub also serves pizza and paninis which you can add toppings to as
        you please, the price increasing the more you add. Like anywhere else in
        College, vegetarian and vegan options are available and if you have any
        concerns, let the staff know of any dietary/allergy requirements.
      </p>
      <p>In the evenings, Schlub also becomes the College Bar!</p>
      <h3>Formals</h3>
      <p>
        Formals are an iconic part of the Cambridge experience and a fun event
        to experience with your friends. As of the 2021/22 academic year, they
        cost £14 for College members and around £17 for external guests (anyone
        not a member of Girton College).
      </p>
      <p>
        Formal halls are often called “value for money” as you receive a
        3-course meal (starter, main and dessert). There are options for
        meat/fish (depending on the night) as well as vegetarian/vegan options
        always listed on the menu. They also provide a nice excuse to wear your
        best suit/dress and your gown.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any allergies, you can let the Catering team know by putting
        these on your “notes” section when booking a formal on Upay. If you have
        stricter dietary needs such as halal or kosher, then do get in contact
        with the Catering Office.
      </p>
      <p>
        More details about formals can be found in the{' '}

        .
      </p>
      <h3>Self-Catering</h3>
      <p>
        There is no obligation to ever eat in college, though a few free events
        may be offered to you during your time such as a free Freshers&apos;
        Formal, Matriculation, Halfway Hall (in 2nd year) and Graduation Feast.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you prefer, you can always cook your own meals. You will know what
        facilities your kitchen has, most have a hob, combi-microwave, as well
        as toasters, fridge and freezer and ovens. Girton&apos;s student
        kitchens are more substantial than some other college&apos;s
        &quot;gyps&quot; which are really designed only for light snacks.
      </p>
      <p>The nearest supermarkets to Girton are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Co-Op - 8-minute walk (120 Girton Rd, Girton CB3 0LW)</li>
        <li>
          Sainbury&apos;s - 6-minute cycle (27 Eddington Avenue, Cambridge CB3
          1SE)
        </li>
        <li>
          Aldi, Iceland - 9-Minute cycle (Histon Road, Cambridge, CB4 3JD)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <CateringMap />
      <p>
        Opposite the road from Aldi and Iceland is Iqbro Halal Grocer, a shop
        which provides halal butchers as well as Afro-Caribbean spices and
        foodstuffs as well as Indian, Pakistani and Bengali staples. It is the
        nearest shop to provide such items, so if you ever need a particular
        seasoning or spice that the other shops don&apos;t have, Iqbro&apos;s
        probably has it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, there is Mill Road, a 20-minute cycle from Girton, on the
        opposite side of town to us. It is a long road stretch which has a
        plethora of Asian and African food shops. There are Pakistani, Chinese,
        Indian and other such Asian and African food shops and markets which
        provide numerous different cuisines and cater to a variety of different
        requirements. You can simply search “Mill Road Cambridge” on Google to
        see what other shops they provide.
